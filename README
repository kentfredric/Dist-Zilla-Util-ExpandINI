Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI

This module builds upon the previous work ":Util::BundleInfo" ( Which
can extract configuration from a bundle in a manner similar to how
"dzil" does it ) and integrates it with some *very* minimal "INI"
handling to provide a tool capable of generating bundle-free "dist.ini"
files from bundle-using "dist.ini" files!

At present its very naïve and only keeps semantic ordering, and I've
probably gotten something wrong due to cutting the complexity of
Config::MVP out of the loop.

But at this stage, bundles are the *only* thing modified in transit.

Every thing else is practically a token-level copy-paste.
