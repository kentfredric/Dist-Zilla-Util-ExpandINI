NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI - Read an INI file and expand bundles as
    you go.

VERSION
    version 0.003000

SYNOPSIS
      # Write a dist.ini with a bundle anywhere you like
      my $string = <<"EOF";
      name = Foo
      version = 1.000

      [@Some::Author]
      EOF

      path('dist.ini.meta')->spew($string);

      # Generate a copy with bundles inlined.
      use Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI;
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_file( 'dist.ini.meta' => 'dist.ini' );

      # Hurrah, dist.ini has all the things!

      # Advanced Usage:
      my $filter = Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->new(
        include_does => [ 'Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer', ],
        exclude_does => [ 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser', ],
      );
      $filter->filter_file( 'dist.ini.meta' => 'dist.ini' );

DESCRIPTION
    This module builds upon the previous work ":Util::BundleInfo" ( Which
    can extract configuration from a bundle in a manner similar to how
    "dzil" does it ) and integrates it with some *very* minimal "INI"
    handling to provide a tool capable of generating bundle-free "dist.ini"
    files from bundle-using "dist.ini" files!

    At present its very naïve and only keeps semantic ordering, and I've
    probably gotten something wrong due to cutting the complexity of
    Config::MVP out of the loop.

    But at this stage, bundles are the *only* thing modified in transit.

    Every thing else is practically a token-level copy-paste.

METHODS
  "filter_file"
                                               #  $source   , $dest
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_file('source.ini','target.ini');

    Reads $source, performs expansions, and emits $dest

  "filter_handle"
      Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_handle($reader,$writer);

    Reads $reader, performs expansions, and emits to $writer

  "filter_string"
      my $return = Dist::Zilla::Util::ExpandINI->filter_string($source);

    Decodes $source, performs expansions, and returns expanded source.

ATTRIBUTES
  "include_does"
    An "ArrayRef" of "Role"s to include in the emitted "INI" from the source
    "INI".

    If this "ArrayRef" is empty, all "Plugin"s will be included.

    This is the default behavior.

      ->new( include_does => [ 'Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider', ] );

    ( "API" Since 0.002000 )

  "exclude_does"
    An "ArrayRef" of "Role"s to *exclude* from the emitted "INI".

    If this "ArrayRef" is empty, *no* "Plugin"s will be *excluded*

    This is the default behavior.

      ->new( exclude_does => [ 'Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser', ] );

    ( "API" Since 0.002000 )

  "comments"
    This attribute controls how comments are handled.

    *   "all" - All comments are copied ( Default )

    *   "authordeps" - Only comments that look like "Dist::Zilla"
        "AuthorDeps" are copied.

    *   "none" - No comments are copied.

    ( "API" Since 0.003000 )

COMMENT PRESERVATION
    Comments are ( since "v0.002000" ) arbitrarily supported in a very basic
    way. But the behavior may be surprising.

      [SectionHeader]
      BODY
      [SectionHeader]
      BODY

    Is how "Config::INI" understands its content. So comment parsing is
    implemented as

      BODY:
        comments: [ "A", "B", "C" ],
        params:   [ "x=y","foo=bar" ]

    So:

      [Header]
      ;A
      x = y ; Trailing Note
      ;B
      foo = bar ; Trailing Note

      ;Remark About Header2
      [Header2]

    Is re-serialized as:

      [Header]
      ;A
      ;B
      ;Remark About Header2
      x = y
      foo = bar

      [Header2]

    This behavior may seem surprising, but its surprising only if you have
    assumptions about how "INI" parsing works.

    This also applies and has strange effects with bundles:

      [Header]
      x = y

      ; CommentAboutBundle
      [@Bundle]
      ; More Comments About Bundle

      [Header2]

    This expands as:

      [Header]
      ; CommentAboutBundle
      x = y

      [BundleHeader1]
      arg = value

      [BundleHeader2]
      arg = value

      [BundleHeader3]
      ; More Comments About Bundle
      arg = value

      [Header2]

    And also note, at this time, only whole-line comments are preserved.
    Suffix comments are stripped.
